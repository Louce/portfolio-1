### [CHAPTER] (2:30) Part 1: The Foundation - Project Setup & Tech Deep Dive

**[On Screen: A clean, empty terminal window.]**

"Alright, first things first, let's get our project bootstrapped. I'm here in my terminal, and we're going to use the official `create-next-app` command. So, type this with me: `npx create-next-app@latest kineticfolio`. We're calling it `kineticfolio`. Now, this will ask us a series of questions that are critical for getting our setup right from the start.

We definitely want to use **TypeScript**, so select 'Yes'. Say 'Yes' to **ESLint** for code quality. 'Yes' to **Tailwind CSS**, which is our styling engine. We'll use the `src/` directory for better organization, so say 'Yes' to that. And crucially, make sure you say 'Yes' to using the **App Router**. It's the modern, powerful, recommended way to build Next.js apps, and this entire tutorial is built around its strengths. Finally, you can say 'No' to customizing the default import alias.

While that's installing, let's quickly talk about why this specific stack is so powerful.

**Next.js with the App Router** is our application's entire skeleton and nervous system. It lets us build full-stack applications in one place. We can have our frontend React components and our backend server logic—like API endpoints—living together in harmony. This simplifies our architecture immensely and enables incredible performance with features like React Server Components.

**Tailwind CSS** is our styling engine. It’s a utility-first CSS framework that will allow us to build completely custom, professional designs without ever leaving our HTML or writing a separate CSS file. You're about to see just how fast and intuitive this is.

And finally, **ShadCN UI**. This is the part that might be new to you, and it's a game-changer. Once our project is open in VS Code, we'll initialize ShadCN. It's not a typical component library you install. Instead, you use its command-line tool to copy the source code of beautifully designed, accessible components directly into your project. This means you **own the code**. You have 100% control to customize it however you want.

Okay, the installation is done. Let's `cd kineticfolio` and open it up in VS Code."

**[On Screen: The newly created project is now open in VS Code. The terminal is visible at the bottom.]**

"Now, to set up ShadCN, we'll run its init command: `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`. It's going to ask you a few questions to configure itself for our project—the defaults it suggests are usually perfect, so you can just press Enter through the prompts. It will detect you're using TypeScript, Default and Neutral for the theme, your `globals.css` file, and that you want to use CSS Variables, which is critical for our theming.

Once that's done, it creates a `components.json` file to store our config and a `lib/utils.ts` file. Now, let's add all the components we'll need for this entire project in one go. Run this command:

`npx shadcn-ui@latest add button card sheet input textarea label toast form badge carousel accordion alert-dialog avatar dialog dropdown-menu popover progress radio-group scroll-area select separator slider switch table tabs tooltip`

Look at that! If you check your `src/components/ui` folder, it's now populated with the full source code for every one of those components. This is the power we're going to leverage. Okay, our foundation is set. Let's start building."

### [CHAPTER] (8:00) Part 2: Global Styles & Layout

**[On Screen: VS Code is focused on `src/app/globals.css`. The file is mostly empty except for the default `@tailwind` directives.]**

"Before we build our components, we need to define the soul of our application: the theme. Open up `src/app/globals.css`. We're going to define all of our colors here using CSS variables, which is the modern and correct way to handle theming, especially for light and dark modes.

**[Narrator types or pastes the CSS variable definitions into the `:root` and `.dark` blocks.]**

I'm defining variables for `--background`, `--foreground`, `--primary`, `--accent`, and so on. By using HSL values, it's incredibly easy to tweak our color palette later. The `.dark` class selector automatically contains all the overrides for our dark theme. Next.js and the `next-themes` package will handle toggling this class on the `<html>` element for us.

Next, let's open `src/app/layout.tsx`. This is the root shell of our entire application. Every page will be wrapped by this component. It's the perfect place for things that need to be on every page, like our font, our navigation bar, and our theme provider.

First, I'll set up the 'Inter' font from `next/font/google`. Then, inside the `<body>` tag, I'll wrap the `children` with the `<ThemeProvider>` from `next-themes`, which we'll need to install. I'll also add our `<Toaster>` component for notifications, and I'll stub out where our `<Navbar>` and `<ThemeSwitcher>` will go. Finally, I'll fill out the `metadata` object. This is super important for SEO—it tells Google and social media sites what our page is about, what title to show, and what image to use for previews. A professional project always has good metadata.

With our global styles and layout configured, we can start building the actual page."

### [CHAPTER] (12:30) Part 3: The Core Build - Crafting the Sections

**[On Screen: VS Code is focused on `src/app/page.tsx`.]**

"Okay, this is where the magic happens. We're going to build out the main sections of our portfolio. A great application is built on solid, reusable foundations. So, before we build the big sections, let's create a couple of essential layout components.

Inside `src/components/layout`, I'll create a `SectionWrapper.tsx` component. This will be a simple `<section>` element that provides consistent padding and vertical centering for each part of our page. It ensures a rhythmic, well-paced scrolling experience.

Next, in `src/components/common`, I'll create a `SectionTitle.tsx` component. Since every section has a title, this ensures they are all styled and, more importantly, animated identically. For its animation, we'll use Framer Motion's `whileInView` property and configure its `viewport` with `{ once: false }`. This is the secret sauce for our project's character: setting `once` to `false` tells Framer Motion to re-run the animation *every single time* the element scrolls into view, creating that dynamic, 'always alive' feeling.

Now, with those helpers ready, our `src/app/page.tsx` becomes incredibly simple and readable. It's just a sequence of our main section components: `<Hero />`, `<About />`, `<Skills />`, `<Projects />`, and so on. This declarative structure is a hallmark of clean React architecture.

Let's flesh out the most impressive section: the **Projects Section**.

**[On Screen: Focus shifts to a new file, `src/components/sections/Projects/Projects.tsx`.]**

First, I'll define a constant called `projectsData`. This will be an array of objects, where each object represents one of our projects, containing its title, description, image URLs, and the tech stack. In a real application, this data would come from a database or a CMS, but for this tutorial, a local constant is perfect.

Now, for the card itself. We're going to create a `ProjectCard` component. This is where we combine our coolest technologies. The root will be a `CardContainer` component, which is a special component we'll build to handle the 3D tilt-on-hover effect. Inside that, we'll use ShadCN's `CardBody` and `CardItem` components.

**[Narrator live-codes the `ProjectCard` component, explaining each part.]**

'The `CardItem` component is really cool. It takes a `translateZ` prop, which tells Framer Motion how much to 'lift' that element off the card when you hover over it, creating that 3D perspective. I'll make the title lift by 60, the description by 50, and so on. For the image, I'm using Next.js's `<Image>` component for automatic optimization. And for the tech stack, I'm mapping over the array and rendering ShadCN's `<Badge>` component.

Now for the 'View Details' button. When this is clicked, we want to open a side panel. For that, we use ShadCN's `<Sheet>` component. The state for the currently selected project will live in our main `Projects` component. When a project is selected, the `<Sheet>` will open.

Inside the `SheetContent`, we're going to put a `<Carousel>` component, another powerful component from ShadCN. We'll pass the media gallery of our selected project to this carousel. I'm also adding the `autoplay` plugin to make it automatically cycle through the images, which feels very professional.

And just like that, by composing these powerful tools—Framer Motion for animation, Next.js for performance, and ShadCN for the UI building blocks—we've created a truly stunning, interactive, and feature-rich project showcase. This is the workflow that modern web development enables."

### [CHAPTER] (24:00) Part 4: The "Wow" Factor - Adding AI

**[On Screen: VS Code is focused on `src/ai/flows/review-feedback-flow.ts`.]**

"Okay, our portfolio is already looking incredible. But what if we could add a truly standout feature that is sure to impress any visitor? Let's add some AI.

Using Google's **Genkit**, we can add a server-side AI flow with just a few lines of code. I've created a file at `src/ai/flows/review-feedback-flow.ts`. Look how clean this is.

First, we define our input and output shapes using **Zod**. We tell the AI we expect to give it a string of feedback text, and we expect to receive a structured object back with a sentiment, a summary, and a suggested action. Using Zod makes our AI interactions type-safe and reliable.

Next, we define the prompt. We're telling the Gemini model, 'You are a helpful assistant. Analyze this feedback and give me a response that matches the JSON schema I defined.'

Finally, we wrap this in a `defineFlow` function. This whole file is a server-side function. Back on our frontend, in the `Feedback` section, we can just `import { reviewFeedback }` and `await` it as if it were a local function. Next.js's Server Actions handle all the complex networking and API creation for us in the background. It feels like magic, but it's just modern web development. With this, our portfolio doesn't just show off projects; it uses AI to actively improve itself based on user input."

### [CHAPTER] (27:00) Final Touches & Deployment

**[On Screen: Browser showing the finished, polished application. Then, switch to the Vercel dashboard.]**

"And with that, the core development of our KineticFolio is complete! Before we wrap up, let's do a final review. We'll check for responsiveness... and as you can see, by using Tailwind's responsive utilities, it looks fantastic on any screen size. We'll scroll up and down one last time, seeing our `once: false` animations re-trigger every single time, keeping the page feeling alive.

Now, what good is an app if you can't share it with the world? Let's deploy it. Since our project is a Next.js app, the best place to host it is **Vercel**, the company that created Next.js.

The process is incredibly simple. First, make sure all your code is pushed to a GitHub repository. Then, sign in to your Vercel account, click 'Add New... > Project', and import that GitHub repository. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and configure all the build settings for you. All you have to do is hit 'Deploy', and in about a minute, your application will be live on the web with a shareable URL. It is truly that simple."
