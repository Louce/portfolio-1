## üõ†Ô∏è Development Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project (2:00 - 4:00)

1.  **Open your terminal.**
2.  **Presenter**: "First, let's create our Next.js project. We'll use `create-next-app`."
    *   Run: `npx create-next-app@latest kineticfolio --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"`
    *   **Presenter explains flags**:
        *   `kineticfolio`: Our project name.
        *   `--typescript`: Enables TypeScript.
        *   `--tailwind`: Sets up Tailwind CSS.
        *   `--eslint`: Includes ESLint for code linting.
        *   `--app`: Uses the new App Router (essential for modern Next.js development).
        *   `--src-dir`: Creates a `src` directory for our code, which is a common convention.
        *   `--import-alias "@/*"`: Allows us to use nice import paths like `@/components`.
    *   **(Show Terminal)** Prompts from `create-next-app`. Choose defaults.
3.  **Navigate into the project directory**: `cd kineticfolio`
4.  **Open the project in your code editor.**
5.  **Run the development server**: `npm run dev`
    *   **(Show Browser)** Verify the default Next.js page loads.
6.  **Initial Cleanup (3:00 - 4:00)**:
    *   Open `src/app/page.tsx`. Remove content within `main`, replace with `<div>Hello KineticFolio</div>`.
    *   Open `src/app/globals.css`. Remove all CSS rules *except* for `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`.
    *   **(Show Browser)** Verify changes.

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies (4:00 - 5:30)

1.  **Stop the development server.**
2.  **Presenter**: "Now, let's install the other key dependencies for UI, forms, and AI."
3.  **Install ShadCN UI related dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate lucide-react @radix-ui/react-slot
    ```
4.  **Install Framer Motion for animations**:
    ```bash
    npm install framer-motion
    ```
5.  **Install React Hook Form & Zod for form handling**:

    ```
7.  **Install Embla Carousel (for ShadCN Carousel)**:
    ```bash
    npm install embla-carousel-react embla-carousel-autoplay
    ```
8.  **Restart the development server**: `npm run dev`

### Step 3: Set up ShadCN UI (5:30 - 7:30)

1.  **Presenter**: "Initialize ShadCN UI."
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest init
    ```
2.  **Follow prompts, explaining choices**: TypeScript (yes), Style (Default), Base Color (Neutral), global CSS (`src/app/globals.css`), CSS variables (yes), Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.ts`), components alias (`@/components`), utils alias (`@/lib/utils`), RSC (yes), `components.json` (yes).
3.  **Presenter**: "ShadCN updates `tailwind.config.ts`, `globals.css`, creates `lib/utils.ts`, `components/ui/`."
4.  **Install initial ShadCN components**:
    *   **Presenter**: "Add components we'll need."
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add button card dialog input textarea label toast form badge carousel
    ```
    *   **(Show Editor)** Briefly show new components in `src/components/ui/`.

### Step 4: Project Structure Review (7:30 - 8:30)

1.  **Presenter**: "Let's establish a clean folder structure. This is crucial."
2.  **(Show Editor)** Review the `src` directory. We'll be creating a few directories.
3.  **Presenter**: "We'll create directories for better organization, following the 'barrel-style' export pattern."
    *   **(Create Folders in Editor & Explain)**
    *   `src/components/primitives/`: For `Box.tsx`, `Flex.tsx`, `Text.tsx`.
    *   `src/components/layout/`: For `SectionWrapper.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`, `ThemeSwitcher.tsx`, `CookieConsentBanner.tsx`.
    *   `src/components/sections/`: "Each main content section will be a component here, *each in its own subdirectory*."
    *   `src/components/common/`: For reusable components like `SectionTitle.tsx`.
    *   `src/components/icons/`: For custom SVG icons.
    *   `src/hooks/`: For custom React hooks.
    *   `src/ai/`: For our AI logic.
        *   `src/ai/flows/`: To hold our Genkit flows.
4.  **Presenter**: "We'll create `index.ts` files in these directories for barrel exports. This allows for cleaner imports, like `import { Box } from '@/components/primitives';`."

### Step 5: Global Styles & Theme (`globals.css`) (8:30 - 10:00)

1.  **Presenter**: "Define our visual identity in `src/app/globals.css`."
2.  Open `src/app/globals.css`.
3.  **Define CSS variables for color theme**: (Paste and explain `:root` and `.dark` blocks from final `globals.css`).
4.  **Add base body styles**: (Add to `@layer base`).

### Step 6: Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) (10:00 - 12:00)

1.  **Presenter**: "Set up our main `src/app/layout.tsx`."
2.  Update metadata (`title`, `description`).
3.  Import Google Fonts (Inter) and set up the CSS variable in `tailwind.config.ts`.
4.  **Structure the body**: Set `className="dark"`, add `Toaster` for notifications, and our layout components: `ThemeSwitcher`, `Navbar`, and `CookieConsentBanner`.

### Step 7: Primitive & Common Components (12:00 - 14:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Create fundamental, reusable building blocks."
1.  Create `src/components/primitives/Box.tsx`, `Flex.tsx`, `Text.tsx`. (Paste code, briefly explain).
2.  Create `src/components/common/SectionTitle.tsx`. (Paste code, explain). Explain the use of `whileInView` and `viewport={{ once: false }}` to ensure the title animates every time it's scrolled into view.
3.  Create barrel export files (`index.ts`) for these directories.

### Step 8: Layout Components (`src/components/layout/`) (14:00 - 17:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Layout components define the main page structure."
1.  Create `src/components/layout/SectionWrapper.tsx`. (Paste code, explain its purpose).
2.  Create `src/components/layout/CookieConsentBanner.tsx`. (Paste code, explain state, effects, Framer Motion).
3.  Create `src/components/layout/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`. (Paste code, explain).
4.  **Create the Floating Navbar**: Create `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**: "Instead of a traditional top bar, we're creating a modern, floating pill navigation. It uses icons for a clean look, with tooltips revealing the section names on hover. It's fixed to the viewport and animates in smoothly."
5.  Update `src/app/layout.tsx` to import and use these components.

### Step 9: Assembling the Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`) (17:00 - 18:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Now let's assemble all our sections on the main page."
1.  Open `src/app/page.tsx`.
2.  **(Paste Code & Explain)**: "Our page is now very simple. It's a container that sequentially renders each section component. We'll add a subtle grid pattern to the background here, which will be visible in the gaps between our sections."
3.  Import and render `Hero`, `About`, `Skills`, `Projects`, `Contact`, and `Feedback`.

### Step 10: Building the Hero Section (`src/components/sections/Hero/Hero.tsx`) (18:00 - 21:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Our first major section! We'll make it really dynamic."
1.  Create `src/components/sections/Hero/Hero.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   Structure: Use `div` with `min-h-screen` instead of `SectionWrapper` for a full-bleed background.
        *   **Visitor Location**: Explain the `useEffect` hook that fetches the visitor's location from `ipwhois.app` on the client-side.
        *   **Animated Text**: Explain the kinetic typography and the cycling sub-headlines using `useState`, `useEffect`, and `AnimatePresence`.
        *   **Scroll Hint**: Add the animated `ChevronDown` icon to guide the user.

### Step 11: Building the About Section (`src/components/sections/About/About.tsx`) (21:00 - 23:00)

*   **Presenter**: "The 'About Me' section."
1.  Create `src/components/sections/About/About.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   Structure: `SectionWrapper`, `Image` (from `next/image`), `Text` components.
        *   **Animate on Scroll**: Point out `whileInView` and `viewport={{ once: false, amount: 0.2 }}`. Explain that `once: false` is what makes the animation re-trigger every time the user scrolls to this section.
        *   **Download Resume Button**: Add `Button` with an `<a>` tag and `download` attribute. Explain that `DendiRivaldi_Resume.pdf` goes in `/public`.

### Step 12: Building the Skills Section (`src/components/sections/Skills/Skills.tsx`) (23:00 - 26:00)

*   **Presenter**: "The interactive skills graph."
1.  Create `src/components/sections/Skills/Skills.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   Data structure for skills and sub-skills.
        *   `SkillNode` component.
        *   **Simplified Hover Logic**: "To prevent flickering when moving between cards, we set the active skill on `onMouseEnter` and only reset it when the mouse leaves the entire grid container (`onMouseLeave`). This is a much more robust approach than using timers."
        *   **Accessibility**: "We add `role="button"` to the `SkillNode` to correctly identify it as an interactive element for screen readers, fixing a common ARIA mismatch issue."
        *   Show how `AnimatePresence` is used to smoothly show/hide the related sub-skills.

### Step 13: Building the Projects Section (`src/components/sections/Projects/Projects.tsx`) (26:00 - 29:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Showcasing work with interactive cards and carousels."
1.  First, create the 3D card component. Create a new folder `src/components/ui/3d-card`, add `card-3d.tsx` and `index.ts`, and export it from the main `ui/index.ts`. (Paste code).
2.  Create `src/components/sections/Projects/Projects.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   `ProjectCard` component using the new `CardContainer` for a 3D tilt effect on hover.
        *   `projectsData` array with project details.
        *   Use of `Dialog` for the modal and `Carousel` (with autoplay) inside to display project media.
        *   Explain the `viewport={{ once: false }}` on the card animations.

### Step 14: Building the Contact Section (`src/components/sections/Contact/Contact.tsx`) (29:00 - 31:00)

*   **Presenter**: "The contact form."
1.  Create `src/components/sections/Contact/Contact.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   Use `react-hook-form` and `zod` for validation.
        *   Apply the grid background to this section's `SectionWrapper` for visual rhythm.
        *   Animate the form elements into view using `whileInView` and `viewport={{ once: false }}`.

### Step 15: Building the Feedback Section with AI (31:00 - 36:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Now for a standout feature. We'll add a feedback system and then enhance it with Generative AI."
1.  **Part 1: The Base System**
    *   Create `src/components/sections/Feedback/Feedback.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code for Base System & Explain)**
        *   Explain the state management for view, user, and feedback data.
        *   Show the mock authentication and feedback submission logic using `localStorage`.
        *   Show how to display and delete feedback for the current user.
2.  **Part 2: Enhancing with Genkit AI**
    *   **Presenter**: "Let's take this to the next level. We'll add an 'AI Review' button that analyzes the feedback."
    *   **Create the AI Config**: Create `src/ai/genkit.ts`. Explain that this file initializes Genkit with the Google AI plugin. (Paste code).
    *   **Create the AI Flow**: Create `src/ai/flows/review-feedback-flow.ts`.
        *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**: "This is a server-side flow. We define input and output structures using Zod. We create a prompt that instructs the AI to analyze feedback for sentiment, a summary, and a suggested action. The `defineFlow` function wraps this logic into a reusable function."
    *   **Update the Frontend**: Go back to `Feedback.tsx`.
        *   Import `reviewFeedback`.
        *   Add state for `analyzingId` and `analysisResults`.
        *   Add the "AI Review" button to each feedback card.
        *   Implement the `handleAiReview` async function to call the flow, handle the loading state, and store the results in state and `localStorage`.
        *   Add the UI to conditionally render the analysis results.

### Step 16: Final Polish & Review (36:00 - 37:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Let's do a final review."
1.  **Responsiveness**: Briefly show the app on a smaller screen size to demonstrate responsiveness.
2.  **Animations**: Scroll up and down the page one last time to showcase how all the `viewport={{ once: false }}` animations make the page feel alive.
3.  **Code Review**: Briefly show the clean `index.ts` barrel exports and the well-organized folder structure.
