## üõ†Ô∏è Development Steps

### Step 1: Initialize Next.js Project (2:00 - 4:00)

1.  **Open your terminal.**
2.  **Presenter**: "First, let's create our Next.js project. We'll use `create-next-app`."
    *   Run: `npx create-next-app@latest kineticfolio --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"`
    *   **Presenter explains flags**:
        *   `kineticfolio`: Our project name.
        *   `--typescript`: Enables TypeScript.
        *   `--tailwind`: Sets up Tailwind CSS.
        *   `--eslint`: Includes ESLint for code linting.
        *   `--app`: Uses the new App Router (essential for modern Next.js development).
        *   `--src-dir`: Creates a `src` directory for our code, which is a common convention.
        *   `--import-alias "@/*"`: Allows us to use nice import paths like `@/components`.
    *   **(Show Terminal)** Prompts from `create-next-app`. Choose defaults.
3.  **Navigate into the project directory**: `cd kineticfolio`
4.  **Open the project in your code editor.**
5.  **Run the development server**: `npm run dev`
    *   **(Show Browser)** Verify the default Next.js page loads.
6.  **Initial Cleanup (3:00 - 4:00)**:
    *   Open `src/app/page.tsx`. Remove content within `main`, replace with `<div>Hello KineticFolio</div>`.
    *   Open `src/app/globals.css`. Remove all CSS rules *except* for `@tailwind base;`, `@tailwind components;`, `@tailwind utilities;`.
    *   **(Show Browser)** Verify changes.

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies (4:00 - 5:30)

1.  **Stop the development server.**
2.  **Presenter**: "Now, let's install the other key dependencies for UI, forms, and AI."
3.  **Install ShadCN UI related dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge tailwindcss-animate lucide-react @radix-ui/react-slot
    ```
4.  **Install Framer Motion for animations**:
    ```bash
    npm install framer-motion
    ```
5.  **Install React Hook Form & Zod for form handling**:
    ```bash
    npm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod
    ```
6.  **Install Genkit for AI features**:
    ```bash
    npm install genkit @genkit-ai/googleai
    ```
7.  **Install Embla Carousel (for ShadCN Carousel)**:
    ```bash
    npm install embla-carousel-react embla-carousel-autoplay
    ```
8.  **Restart the development server**: `npm run dev`

### Step 3: Set up ShadCN UI (5:30 - 7:30)

1.  **Presenter**: "Initialize ShadCN UI."
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest init
    ```
2.  **Follow prompts, explaining choices**: TypeScript (yes), Style (Default), Base Color (Neutral), global CSS (`src/app/globals.css`), CSS variables (yes), Tailwind config (`tailwind.config.ts`), components alias (`@/components`), utils alias (`@/lib/utils`), RSC (yes), `components.json` (yes).
3.  **Presenter**: "ShadCN updates `tailwind.config.ts`, `globals.css`, creates `lib/utils.ts`, `components/ui/`."
4.  **Install initial ShadCN components**:
    *   **Presenter**: "Add components we'll need."
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add button card dialog input textarea label toast form badge carousel
    ```
    *   **(Show Editor)** Briefly show new components in `src/components/ui/`.

### Step 4: Project Structure Review (7:30 - 8:30)

1.  **Presenter**: "Let's establish a clean folder structure. This is crucial."
2.  **(Show Editor)** Review the `src` directory. We'll be creating a few directories.
3.  **Presenter**: "We'll create directories for better organization, following the 'barrel-style' export pattern."
    *   **(Create Folders in Editor & Explain)**
    *   `src/components/primitives/`: For `Box.tsx`, `Flex.tsx`, `Text.tsx`.
    *   `src/components/layout/`: For `SectionWrapper.tsx`, `Navbar.tsx`, `ThemeSwitcher.tsx`, `CookieConsentBanner.tsx`.
    *   `src/components/sections/`: "Each main content section will be a component here, *each in its own subdirectory*."
    *   `src/components/common/`: For reusable components like `SectionTitle.tsx`.
    *   `src/components/icons/`: For custom SVG icons.
    *   `src/hooks/`: For custom React hooks.
    *   `src/ai/`: For our AI logic.
        *   `src/ai/flows/`: To hold our Genkit flows.
4.  **Presenter**: "We'll create `index.ts` files in these directories for barrel exports. This allows for cleaner imports, like `import { Box } from '@/components/primitives';`."

### Step 5: Global Styles & Theme (`globals.css`) (8:30 - 10:00)

1.  **Presenter**: "Define our visual identity in `src/app/globals.css`."
2.  Open `src/app/globals.css`.
3.  **Define CSS variables for color theme**: (Paste and explain `:root` and `.dark` blocks from final `globals.css`).
4.  **Add base body styles**: (Add to `@layer base`).

### Step 6: Root Layout (`src/app/layout.tsx`) (10:00 - 12:00)

1.  **Presenter**: "Now, let's configure our main `src/app/layout.tsx`. This file is the root of our entire application, wrapping every page. We'll set up our global styles, fonts, and the main layout components that are present everywhere, like our navigation and theme switcher."
2.  Update metadata (`title`, `description`) to improve SEO.
3.  Import the Inter font from `next/font/google` and set it up as a CSS variable in `tailwind.config.ts`. This is the modern, performant way to handle custom fonts in Next.js.
4.  **Structure the body**: We'll set the default theme to dark by adding `className="dark"` to the `html` tag. We'll then add our global `Toaster` for notifications and our key layout components: `ThemeSwitcher`, the floating `Navbar`, and the `CookieConsentBanner`. These will now be present on every page of our site.

### Step 7: Primitive & Common Components (12:00 - 14:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Great applications are built on solid foundations. To keep our code clean and reusable, we'll create a set of primitive components. These are simple wrappers around basic HTML elements, like `Box` for a `div` or `Text` for a paragraph, which we can reuse everywhere."
1.  Create `src/components/primitives/Box.tsx`, `Flex.tsx`, `Text.tsx`. (Paste code, briefly explain).
2.  **Presenter**: "We'll also create a `SectionTitle` component. Since almost every section has a title, creating a shared component ensures they are all styled consistently and, more importantly, animated consistently. We'll use Framer Motion's `whileInView` with `viewport={{ once: false }}`. This is a key detail: setting `once` to `false` means the title will animate beautifully every single time it's scrolled into view, whether you're scrolling down or up."
3.  Create `src/components/common/SectionTitle.tsx`. (Paste code, explain).
4.  Create barrel export files (`index.ts`) for these directories to simplify our import paths.

### Step 8: Layout Components (`src/components/layout/`) (14:00 - 17:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Now for the main structure. Our layout components define the scaffolding of our page."
1.  Create `src/components/layout/SectionWrapper.tsx`. (Paste code, explain its purpose of providing consistent padding and centering).
2.  Create `src/components/layout/CookieConsentBanner.tsx`. (Paste code, explain state, effects, Framer Motion).
3.  Create `src/components/layout/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`. (Paste code, explain).
4.  **Create the Floating Navbar**: Create `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**: "Instead of a traditional top bar that takes up space, we're creating a modern, floating pill navigation. It's fixed to the viewport and uses clean icons with tooltips that appear on hover to reveal the section names. This keeps the UI minimal and elegant while still being easy to navigate. It animates in smoothly for a polished feel."
5.  Update `src/app/layout.tsx` to import and use these components.

### Step 9: Assembling the Main Page (`src/app/page.tsx`) (17:00 - 18:00)

*   **Presenter**: "With our layout in place, let's assemble all our sections on the main page. Thanks to our component-based architecture, `src/app/page.tsx` becomes incredibly simple and readable."
1.  Open `src/app/page.tsx`.
2.  **(Paste Code & Explain)**: "Our page is now a simple container that sequentially renders each section component: `Hero`, `About`, `Skills`, and so on. We'll add a subtle grid pattern to the background here. This pattern will be visible in the gaps between our sections, creating a nice visual texture that ties the whole design together."
3.  Import and render all the section components.

### Step 10: Building the Hero Section (`src/components/sections/Hero/Hero.tsx`) (18:00 - 21:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Now for our first major section, the Hero! This is the first thing users see, so we want it to be impressive. We'll make it really dynamic."
1.  Create `src/components/sections/Hero/Hero.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   Structure: We'll use a `div` with `min-h-screen` to make it take up the full viewport, creating a more immersive entry point than our standard `SectionWrapper`.
        *   **Visitor Location**: As a neat, personalized touch, we'll add a feature that fetches the visitor's location using a free API. We'll use a `useEffect` hook to call `ipwhois.app` on the client-side, making sure it doesn't slow down the server render.
        *   **Animated Text**: The headline uses kinetic typography, and below it, we have a cycling sub-headline that rotates through key skills. This is achieved with `useState`, `useEffect`, and Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence` for smooth transitions.
        *   **Scroll Hint**: Finally, we'll add an animated `ChevronDown` icon to gently guide the user to scroll down and explore the rest of the page.

### Step 11: Building the About Section (`src/components/sections/About/About.tsx`) (21:00 - 23:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Next up is the 'About Me' section. This is where we tell our story. We'll combine text and imagery with subtle animations."
1.  Create `src/components/sections/About/About.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   Structure: We'll use `SectionWrapper` for consistent padding, and a flexbox layout to place an image next to the text content.
        *   **Animate on Scroll**: We'll use `whileInView` and `viewport={{ once: false, amount: 0.2 }}`. I want to emphasize `once: false` again. This is the setting that makes the animation re-trigger every time the user scrolls to this section, creating that continuously dynamic feel we're aiming for.
        *   **Download Resume Button**: We'll add a prominent `Button` with an `<a>` tag and a `download` attribute. This is a standard and effective way to offer a resume. We'll just need to place the `DendiRivaldi_Resume.pdf` file in the `/public` directory.

### Step 12: Building the Skills Section (`src/components/sections/Skills/Skills.tsx`) (23:00 - 26:00)

*   **Presenter**: "The skills section is a great opportunity to get creative. Instead of a boring list, we'll build an interactive skills graph."
1.  Create `src/components/sections/Skills/Skills.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   Data Structure: We'll start by defining our skills and related sub-skills in a clear data structure.
        *   `SkillNode` Component: Each core skill will be a `SkillNode` component.
        *   **Simplified Hover Logic**: "We previously encountered a flickering issue when moving the mouse between cards. We'll solve this with a much more robust approach. We'll set the active skill on `onMouseEnter` and only reset it when the mouse leaves the *entire grid container* (`onMouseLeave`). This elegant solution eliminates the need for timers and debounce logic."
        *   **Accessibility Fix**: "We also had an accessibility issue where ARIA attributes didn't match their roles. We'll fix this by adding `role="button"` to the `SkillNode`. This correctly identifies it as an interactive element for screen readers, resolving the error."
        *   We'll use `AnimatePresence` to smoothly show and hide the related sub-skills as the user hovers over different core skills.

### Step 13: Building the Projects Section (`src/components/sections/Projects/Projects.tsx`) (26:00 - 29:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Showcasing projects is the heart of any portfolio. We'll create a gallery of project cards that are interactive and lead to more detailed views."
1.  **Presenter**: "First, to make our cards pop, we'll implement a cool 3D tilt effect on hover. We'll create a new reusable component called `CardContainer` in `src/components/ui/3d-card`." (Paste code for the 3D card).
2.  Create `src/components/sections/Projects/Projects.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   We'll use our new `CardContainer` to wrap each `ProjectCard`, instantly giving it the 3D tilt effect.
        *   `projectsData`: We'll define all project information in a `projectsData` array.
        *   **Modal with Carousel**: "When a user clicks 'View Details', we'll open a `Dialog` modal. Inside this modal, we'll use the ShadCN `Carousel` component with the autoplay plugin to showcase multiple images or videos for each project. This is a great way to show off different aspects of your work in a compact space."
        *   Again, we'll use `viewport={{ once: false }}` on the card animations so they animate in every time they appear on screen.

### Step 14: Building the Contact Section (`src/components/sections/Contact/Contact.tsx`) (29:00 - 31:00)

*   **Presenter**: "The contact section is our call to action. We need a clean and simple form."
1.  Create `src/components/sections/Contact/Contact.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**
        *   We'll use `react-hook-form` and `zod` for robust and easy form validation.
        *   To add some visual rhythm to the page, we'll apply the subtle grid background to this section's `SectionWrapper`, creating an alternating pattern.
        *   Finally, we'll animate the form elements into view using `whileInView` and `viewport={{ once: false }}` to maintain our dynamic feel.

### Step 15: Building the Feedback Section with AI (31:00 - 36:00)

*   **Presenter**: "Now for a standout feature that will really impress. We'll add a feedback system and then enhance it with Generative AI."
1.  **Part 1: The Base System**
    *   Create `src/components/sections/Feedback/Feedback.tsx`.
    *   **(Paste Code for Base System & Explain)**
        *   "First, we build the core functionality. We'll use React state to manage the view (login, signup, or manage feedback), the current user, and the feedback data. To persist the data without a database, we'll use the browser's `localStorage`. This is a great way to prototype features quickly. We'll implement mock authentication and functions to submit, display, and delete feedback."
2.  **Part 2: Enhancing with Genkit AI**
    *   **Presenter**: "Now, let's take this to the next level. We'll add an 'AI Review' button that analyzes the user's feedback using Google's Gemini model."
    *   **Create the AI Config**: Create `src/ai/genkit.ts`. "This file is our AI configuration hub. It's where we initialize Genkit with the necessary plugins, in this case, the `@genkit-ai/googleai` plugin." (Paste code).
    *   **Create the AI Flow**: Create `src/ai/flows/review-feedback-flow.ts`.
        *   **(Paste Code & Explain)**: "This is a server-side AI flow. A flow is a function that orchestrates AI models and other logic. Here, we define the expected input and output structures using Zod for type safety. Then, we create a prompt that instructs the AI to act as a helpful assistant, analyzing feedback for its sentiment, providing a summary, and suggesting an action. The `defineFlow` function wraps this all up into a secure, reusable function we can call from our frontend."
    *   **Update the Frontend**: Go back to `Feedback.tsx`.
        *   "Now we connect the frontend. We'll import our `reviewFeedback` flow. We'll add state to track which feedback item is currently being analyzed and to store the results. We add an 'AI Review' button to each feedback card. When clicked, it calls our AI flow, handles the loading state, and stores the structured result in both our component's state and `localStorage` for persistence. Finally, we'll add the UI to conditionally render the analysis results in a clean, readable format."

### Step 16: Final Polish & Review (36:00 - 37:00)

*   **Presenter**: "And with that, our core development is complete! Let's do a final review."
1.  **Responsiveness**: "Let's quickly check the site on a smaller screen size. As you can see, our flexible layouts and components adapt beautifully, providing a great experience on mobile."
2.  **Animations**: "Now, let's scroll up and down the page one last time. Notice how every section animates into view, every time. This `viewport={{ once: false }}` setting is what gives the page its incredibly alive and responsive feel."
3.  **Code Quality**: "And let's not forget our codebase. By using a clean folder structure and barrel exports, our project is well-organized, easy to maintain, and a pleasure to work with."
