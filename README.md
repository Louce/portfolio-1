Welcome to the KineticFolio project! This document serves as your primary guide for understanding, running, and contributing to the application. It's written with a new developer in mind, so we'll cover everything from the high-level vision to the nitty-gritty of the code structure.

## 1. Project Vision

KineticFolio is a visually stunning, one-page portfolio made by me **Dendi Rivaldi**. It aims to be more than a static digital resume; it's designed to be an interactive art installation that showcases skills not just with words, but through the very experience of using it.

The core design philosophy is **"Kinetic Elegance,"** creating an "unfolding narrative" where each section animates into view, providing an engaging and memorable user experience.

## 2. Core Features

-   **Dynamic Hero Section**: A captivating entry point with a 3D animated title and a "split-flap" sub-headline display.
-   **AI-Powered Avatar**: The "About Me" section features an interactive avatar that can be regenerated in different artistic styles using AI image generation.
-   **Animated Section Transitions**: Fluid animations powered by Framer Motion create a seamless scrolling experience.
-   **Modern Skills Showcase**: An organized and instantly scannable display of core competencies using "spec cards" with animated badges.
-   **3D-Effect Project Gallery**: Project cards feature a 3D tilt effect on hover, opening into a detailed view with an image carousel.
-   **Full-Stack Feedback System**: A mock-authentication system allows users to leave feedback, which can then be analyzed for sentiment and summary using Google's AI via Genkit.
-   **Responsive Design & Theming**: The site is fully responsive and features a beautiful light/dark mode theme switcher integrated into the main navigation.

## 3. Technical Architecture & Architectural Principles

This project uses a modern, opinionated tech stack and is built upon core software engineering principles that ensure its quality, maintainability, and scalability.

-   **Framework**: **Next.js (App Router)**
    -   **Why?**: We use the App Router for its performance benefits (React Server Components), intuitive file-based routing, and powerful features like Server Actions, which allow us to write backend logic (like our AI flow) without needing a separate server.

-   **Component Toolkit**: **Shadcn/UI**
    -   **Why?**: Shadcn is **not** a typical component library. Instead of installing a package, you use its CLI to **copy component source code** directly into the project (`src/components/ui`). This gives us the best of both worlds: the speed of pre-built, accessible components and the 100% control to customize their style and logic as needed.

-   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS**
    -   **Why?**: Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for rapid, custom UI development without writing a single line of custom CSS. All styles are co-located with the components, making them easy to manage and update. Theming is handled via CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css`.

-   **Animation**: **Framer Motion**
    -   **Why?**: It provides a simple, declarative API for creating complex, production-grade animations directly within our React components.

-   **Generative AI**: **Genkit**
    -   **Why?**: Genkit is Google's open-source framework for building AI-powered features. We use it on the server-side (as a Next.js Server Action) to securely call the Gemini model for feedback analysis and image generation.

### Architectural Principles in Practice

This project's architecture is built on three core software design principles:

-   **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: This is our guiding star. Every part of the application has a distinct, well-defined job.
    -   **Presentation (`/src/components`)**: Components only handle how things look.
    -   **Content (`/src/data`)**: All static text (project info, skills) is stored in a dedicated "content layer," making updates easy.
    -   **Data Persistence (`/src/services`)**: The `feedbackService` handles *how* data is stored (`localStorage`). The rest of the app doesn't know or care, making it easy to swap in a real database later.
    -   **Stateful UI Logic (`/src/hooks`)**: Complex UI state (like for the feedback feature) is extracted into custom hooks to keep components clean.
    -   **Client-Side Providers (`/src/app/providers.tsx`)**: All client-only providers (`ThemeProvider`, etc.) are separated from the main server-rendered `layout.tsx` for better performance.

-   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each component has one, and only one, reason to change.
    -   The `Projects.tsx` component's only job is to manage state. It delegates the work of rendering to `ProjectCard.tsx` (for summaries) and `ProjectDetailSheet.tsx` (for details). Each has a single, focused job.

-   **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: We avoid code duplication by creating reusable abstractions.
    -   The `SectionWrapper.tsx` component provides consistent padding and layout for all main sections.
    -   Custom utility classes in `globals.css` (like `.bg-grid-pattern`) abstract complex CSS so it can be applied with a single class.

## 4. Getting Started: Local Development

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js**: v18.0 or later
-   **npm** (or yarn/pnpm)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the project to your local machine.

```bash
# git clone <repository-url>
cd kineticfolio
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install all the required packages using npm.

```bash
npm install
```
This command reads the `package.json` file and installs all the necessary libraries.

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

Start the local development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the Next.js application in development mode with Turbopack for maximum speed. Once it's running, you can view the application by opening your browser and navigating to:

**http://localhost:3000**

The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the code.

## 5. Codebase Deep Dive: Understanding the Structure

```

## 6. How to Customize and Contribute

### Updating Content

-   **Project Information**: To change project details, open **`src/data/projectsData.ts`** and edit the `projectsData` array.
-   **Skill Information**: To update skills, open **`src/data/skillsData.ts`** and modify the `coreSkillsData` and `subSkillsData` arrays.
-   **About Me Text**: To change the bio, open **`src/data/aboutData.ts`**.
-   **Other Text**: Most other text can be found directly within the respective section component in `src/components/sections/`.

### Changing Styles

-   **Colors & Theme**: To change the color palette for light and dark modes, edit the HSL CSS variables at the top of **`src/app/globals.css`**.
-   **Component Styles**: To change the style of a specific element, find the component file and modify its Tailwind CSS utility classes.

### Replacing Images & Assets

-   **Resume**: Replace the `DendiRivaldi_Resume.pdf` file in the `/public` directory with your own.
-   **Images**: Project images are defined in **`src/data/projectsData.ts`**. The project uses high-quality images from `images.unsplash.com`. You can replace these URLs with your own. The AI avatar in the "About" section can be changed by updating the `initialImage` constant in `src/components/sections/About/components/AvatarGenerator.tsx`.
